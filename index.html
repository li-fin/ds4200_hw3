            Hello! My name is Fin. I'm a 3rd year college student based in New England studying data science and marine science. 
            <br>
            I love fish. I love to study them, eat them, fish them (when I can)â€”and make art of them. 
            I started painting fish in high school when I had access to acrylics, and now I recreationally draw fish 
            via digital art (Procreate on the iPad). In some cases, I am inspired by scientific illustration, but I generally
            just draw fish however I like (sometimes realistic, sometimes not). This is a very casual hobby.
            <br>
            I have compiled some of my fish art here. See <a href="fish.html">Fish Art</a>!
            <br>
            <br>
            (This is a demo website created for a HW assignment for DS 4200, Information Presentation and Visualization.
            I am not actively updating this website with more fish art, nor does this serve as a portfolio. 
            If you are interested in learning more about me, refer to my LinkedIn. Maybe I'll make an actual personal website eventually.)
